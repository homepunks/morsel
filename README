Translate your text files to International Morse code. In the output, you get both
the textual and audio translation. (Project uses FFMPEG but I don't know if I want
either of us to compile it with cargo, so just make sure you have the binaries
installed). We might get rid of this dependency in favour of some lighter crate, if
I manage to find it.

I do not endorse using Cargo if the project does not plan using external packages.
Compiler is all you need.

Use:
	cargo run --release -- examples/plain.txt
	# or:
	rustc src/main.rs
	./main examples/plain.txt

	cat MORSE
	ffplay MORSE.ogg
